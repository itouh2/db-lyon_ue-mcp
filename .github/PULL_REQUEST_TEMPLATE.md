<!-- One or two sentences. What this does, not why it is good. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem. Link the issue: Closes #NNN. Delete if the title says it. -->

## Verification

<!-- What you actually ran. Delete the lines you did not run; do not leave
     one ticked that you skipped. Live rows need the editor on tests/ue_mcp. -->
