/**
 * Write classification for the source-control guard.
 *
 * The guard needs to know, for a given bridge method + params, which asset
 * content paths the call is about to modify, so it can check them out (or refuse
 * on a human's lock) BEFORE the write reaches disk. This module is the single
 * place that encodes that knowledge.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   1. An explicit map for methods whose path lives under an unusual param
 *      shape (batches, rename descriptors).
 *   2. The method's DECLARED effect plus a recognizable asset-path param. A
 *      declared read writes nothing whatever path it was handed; anything else
 *      is a candidate.
 *
 * Layer two used to be a hand-written list of write verbs matched against the
 * method NAME, and the list is gone rather than kept as a fallback: there is
 * nothing left for it to answer. `bridgeMethodEffect` has no undefined case,
 * so every method reaching here has an effect from the actions that forward to
 * it, from the table of methods a handler calls directly, or from the default
 * that treats an unrecognised method as a change. The list was also wrong in
 * the expensive direction: `unwrap_uvs` rewrites a mesh's UV layout in place
 * and `mesh_boolean` overwrites a StaticMesh package, and neither matched it,
 * so neither was ever checked out before the write reached disk.
 *
 * Classification returns UE content paths (e.g. "/Game/Foo"). Resolving those to
 * on-disk files, and deciding which already exist (modify -> checkout) versus do
 * not (create -> skip, it will be `p4 add`ed later), is the caller's job.
 *
 * Design note: this is intentionally conservative. An unmapped write falls
 * through as "not a write" (fail-open). The cost of a miss is that the agent
 * hits Unreal's own read-only failure and can check out explicitly - visible,
 * not silent corruption. The cost of a false positive is an unnecessary
 * checkout, which takes a lock. We bias toward not over-locking.
