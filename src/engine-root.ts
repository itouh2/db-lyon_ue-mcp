/**
 * One resolver for "which engine does this project use" (#959, #961, #962, #974).
 *
 * Two separate discovery paths used to answer that question and they answered
 * it differently. `findUEBuildTool` probed launcher install locations, and the
 * engine-source readers in `tools/project.ts` asked `findEngineInstall` about
 * the .uproject's EngineAssociation and gave up when that came back null. A
 * source build sitting beside the project - the standard Perforce stream layout
 * of `<root>/Engine` next to `<root>/MyProject/MyProject.uproject` - was
 * invisible to both, even though `Build.bat` was right there and the editor
 * launched out of that same tree.
 *
 * Everything that needs an engine now goes through `selectEngine` here, so the
 * build tool and the engine-source readers cannot drift apart again.
 *
 * Order, most specific first:
 *
 *   1. `UE_MCP_TEST_ENGINE_ROOT`     an explicit pin for the whole process
 *   2. `UE_BUILD_TOOL_PATH`          an explicit build tool for the process
 *   3. `editor.buildToolPath`        the per-project equivalent (#817)
 *   4. `UE_EDITOR_PATH`              an explicit editor binary names its tree
 *   5. `editor.path`                 the per-project equivalent (#817)
 *   6. EngineAssociation as a path   relative or absolute, which is what a
 *                                    project beside a source build carries
 *   7. project-relative engine tree  walk up from the project directory for
 *                                    `Engine/Build/BatchFiles/<Build script>`
 *   8. EngineAssociation registered  a GUID through HKCU registered builds,
 *                                    a version string through the launcher
 *   9. last editor launch            the engine the project's own log says it
 *                                    was last opened with
 *  10. default engine install        the launcher locations probed before
 *
 * `UE_MCP_PROTECTED_ENGINE_ROOTS` outranks every one of them, including an
 * explicit pin: a root named there is never selected, the same contract
 * `scripts/build-utils.js` enforces for test builds.
