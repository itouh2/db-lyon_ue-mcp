/**
 * The execute_python gate: matching a caller's rulings against the candidate
 * actions a tool search returned (#960, #938).
 *
 * The gate is the front door to this project's feedback pipeline. Every Python
 * escape hatch is a recorded gap, and the record only exists if the agent gets
 * through the gate and runs the code. Two separate reporters found that it
 * could not be satisfied at all, for two different reasons:
 *
 *  1. The refusal printed the qualified spelling, `editor(invoke_function)`,
 *     and then matched what came back against the bare `invoke_function`.
 *     Passing back exactly the strings the tool had just printed did not
 *     satisfy it. Matching is now spelling-insensitive: bare, `tool(action)`
 *     and `tool.action` all resolve to the same key.
 *
 *  2. The candidate set is recomputed from the taskSummary on every call, so
 *     rewording the summary swapped in candidates that then had to be ruled out
 *     as well. One reporter needed five re-justifications for one unchanged
 *     intent. Accepted rulings are now remembered for the session, so a reword
 *     can only ever add the candidates that are genuinely new, and the refusal
 *     hands back the exact `ruledOut` array to send.
 *
 * A reason shorter than MIN_REASON_LENGTH used to be dropped in silence, which
 * left the caller re-sending an entry the gate had thrown away without saying
 * so. Those are now reported back by name.
