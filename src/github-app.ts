 * Hosted signing endpoints for the anonymous bot path, in the order they are

 *
 * This package holds no GitHub App credential. Anonymous reports are POSTed as
 * plain JSON to the endpoint, which holds the App key in server-side secrets,
 * mints a short-lived installation token, and opens the issue.
 *
 * Feedback has its own public name, `feedback.ue-mcp.com`, so it is no longer
 * addressed through the plugin registry's hostname. The registry path stays as
 * a fallback for two reasons: a deployment older than that name, or self-hosted,
 * still answers there, and while DNS for the new name propagates the anonymous
 * path keeps working instead of going dark.
 *
 * Overrides:
 *   UE_MCP_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT  full URL. Exact, and the only candidate: an
 *                             operator who named a URL means that URL, and
 *                             silently posting somewhere else would be worse
 *                             than failing.
 *   UE_MCP_FEEDBACK           origin only, root path.
 *   UE_MCP_REGISTRY           when set without UE_MCP_FEEDBACK, that self-hosted
 *                             origin is tried first, since its operator meant
 *                             their deployment, not the public one.
