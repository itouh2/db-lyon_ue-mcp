/**
 * How long the client waits for a bridge call to answer (#989).
 *
 * The client waited a flat 30 seconds for every method. Two things were wrong
 * with that, and both produce the same bad outcome: the editor completes the
 * operation, the client reports a failure, and a naive retry applies the
 * mutation a second time.
 *
 *  1. Some calls are simply long. A 190-item batch on a machine that is also
 *     compiling shaders does not finish inside 30 seconds. Callers can now pass
 *     a `timeoutMs` and be believed.
 *
 *  2. The two ends disagreed. The C++ side registers a per-handler timeout via
 *     FMCPHandlerRegistry::RegisterHandlerWithTimeout, and the game-thread
 *     executor waits that long before giving up. delete_exact_labeled_actors_in_levels
 *     is allowed 300 seconds there and was cut off by the client at 30, so the
 *     server's own limit could never be reached and its error could never be
 *     read. The client now waits at least as long as the server said it would.
 *
 * The registered timeouts are NOT advertised. get_bridge_capabilities publishes
 * the protocol version, the feature list and the registered action names, but
 * not their timeouts, so there is no way to read this off the wire from a
 * plugin that is already built. Inventing a field would mean a protocol change
 * on the C++ side. The table below therefore mirrors the registrations by hand,
 * and tests/unit/bridge-timeout-parity.test.ts parses the plugin sources and
 * fails when the two drift apart. A mirror nobody checks is worse than none.
