 * What an action does to the editor it is addressed to.

 *   read    observes. Changes neither the editor, its project on disk, nor its
 *           process. Landing one in the wrong editor returns the wrong answer
 *           and changes nothing.
 *   mutate  may change any of those, or has an effect outside the editor
 *           (writes a file, posts an issue, launches or quits a process).
 *   unknown decided by a PARAMETER rather than by the action, so the
 *           declaration cannot say. An arbitrary python string, a console
 *           command and a wrapped third-party tool are the real cases. Gated
 *           as `mutate` everywhere, so the honest label costs nothing at a
 *           gate.
 *
 * Two rules settle the cases that come up while declaring one:
 *
 *   Declare what the action is FOR. An action that offers a `dryRun` is still
 *   a `mutate`: previewing is a mode, not the purpose. `unknown` is for an
 *   action with no inherent direction at all, where a parameter supplies the
 *   whole of what it does.
 *
 *   A response written to a file is still a response. An action whose only
 *   write is the caller-named destination for its own result reads;
 *   `asset(bulk_read_properties)` spilling rows to `outputPath` is a large
 *   answer, not an edit. An action that writes into the addressed project or
 *   into the editor's own state mutates, even when what it writes was derived
 *   from a read.
 *
 * Every variant of `ActionSpec` requires this, which is the point of it. It
 * used to live nowhere, and three separate places each guessed it by matching
 * an action's NAME against a list of verbs. A list of verbs is open-ended and
 * the set of actions is not, so every verb missing from a list was an action
 * classified by accident: a guard asked to stand in front of every mutation
 * matched 542 of 1090 actions and let `write_cpp_file`, `build`, `sculpt`,
 * `place_actor` and every bare verb like `save` and `create` past it.
 *
 * The lesson was already written down one field below, on `destinationEditor`:
 * "Declared on the action rather than assumed from its name." It was applied to
 * a routing flag that affects one action, and not to the field that decides
 * whether a guard sees a call at all.
