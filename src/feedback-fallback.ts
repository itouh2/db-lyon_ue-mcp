/**
 * What feedback(submit) does when the elicitation gate cannot reach a human
 * (#991).
 *
 * The gate is the only approval channel the server has, and some clients
 * answer it themselves: the VS Code Claude Code extension auto-declines in
 * 15 to 75ms, before anything is rendered. The "too fast to be human"
 * detection catches that correctly, but until now the report died there. A
 * team ran into it eight times in a week and had to retype every report by
 * hand somewhere else.
 *
 * The fallback needs nothing from the client, which is the whole point:
 *
 *   1. The scrubbed payload is written to disk, in the same pending-feedback
 *      store `npx ue-mcp feedback list/approve/discard` already reads. So the
 *      report survives the session even if nobody clicks anything.
 *   2. A prefilled `github.com/.../issues/new?title=&body=` URL is handed
 *      back. One click lands the user in the issue form with the body already
 *      written, no auth, no elicitation, no CLI.
 *   3. A short confirmation token is written into the report file. If the
 *      user says "yes, submit it" in plain text, they can read the token out
 *      of the file and have the agent pass it back on a second
 *      feedback(submit) call, which posts the exact stored bytes.
 *
 * Door 3 is a human-confirmation speed bump, not an authorization boundary:
 * an agent with filesystem access can read the token itself. It exists so a
 * user who WANTS to approve has a path that ends in a posted issue, and it is
 * deliberately the last of the three. Doors 1 and 2 need no trust at all.

/**
 * Cap on the whole prefilled URL, measured AFTER percent-encoding.
 *
 * Browsers and GitHub both start truncating somewhere north of 8KB, and a
 * truncated query string produces a half-written issue body rather than an
 * error, which is worse than no link. 6000 leaves headroom for the origin,
 * the path, and any redirect GitHub adds on the way to the login wall.
 *
 * Measuring the encoded length is the part that matters: a body of 5000 plain
 * characters full of newlines and backticks encodes to well over 15000.
