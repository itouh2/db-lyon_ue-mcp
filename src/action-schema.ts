/**
 * The live parameter schema for one action.
 *
 * `project(search_tools)` finds an action by keyword but hands back only its
 * prose. An agent that has located `asset.set_property` still has to guess
 * whether the path parameter is `assetPath`, `path` or `asset`, and a guess
 * that is wrong does not fail loudly: a category's zod shape strips keys it
 * does not declare, so a misspelled parameter reaches the handler as
 * `undefined` and the call returns a plausible-looking result for a mutation
 * that never happened.
 *
 * This module answers the question directly, from three independent sources:
 *
 *   documented  the `Params:` clause authored in the action's description
 *   forwards    the keys the action's `mapParams` closure actually reads
 *   declared    the category's zod shape, which is what the wire accepts
 *
 * `declared` is the only one of the three that is load-bearing at runtime, so
 * a name present in either of the other two and absent from it is a silent
 * drop rather than a documentation nit. `schemaDrift()` reports exactly those,
 * and a unit test gates the whole surface on it.

 *
 *   OR or | either   a choice: supply one side, not both

 * which makes the names behind it a choice, or with a connective (`plus`,
 * `then`, `EITHER`) continuing the previous item.
 *
 * Everything else at depth zero ends the item, because the prose has resumed:
 * a bare word that is not a separator (`renames[] where each entry is ...`),
 * or a character that cannot start a name (`all=true`, `- uses its agent`).

 * The rule that matters most is what is NOT here. There is no list of English
 * words that are refused in parameter position. `value`, `all`, `from`, `to`,
 * `min`, `max` and `name` are real parameters on this surface, and a filter
