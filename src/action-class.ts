/**
 * Read / mutate / unknown classification of the action surface (#817, plan 5.1).
 *
 * This exists for one decision: while this server drives more than one editor,
 * a call that does not name its target falls through to the active session. For
 * a read that is harmless. For anything that changes an editor, its project on
 * disk, or its process, a wrong guess edits somebody else's project, so those
 * calls have to name the editor they mean.
 *
 * Why this is not `flow/write-methods.ts` or `locking.ts`:
 *
 *   - `classifyWrite` (source-control guard) answers "which content paths is
 *     this call about to write", and returns `writes: false` whenever it cannot
 *     extract a path. A call with no asset path in its params is still a
 *     mutation of the editor.
 *   - `classifyAction` (asset locking) answers "should this call take a lock",
 *     and deliberately collapses everything it does not recognise into
 *     `mutates: false` so locking never blocks a call it cannot classify.
 *
 * Both are load-bearing where they are and both fail open, which is the exact
 * opposite of what a routing gate needs. So this module answers a third
 * question, three-way, and fails closed. It is not a parallel scheme: the verb
 * lexicon is `locking.ts`'s, imported and extended rather than restated, and a
 * test asserts this module never contradicts locking's verdict.
 *
 * The taxonomy is stated in terms of the ADDRESSED EDITOR:
 *
 *   read    observes. Does not change the editor, its project on disk, or its
 *           process. Landing one in the wrong editor returns the wrong answer
 *           and changes nothing.
 *   mutate  may change any of those three, or has an external side effect
 *           (writes a file, posts an issue, launches or quits a process).
 *   unknown cannot be determined from the action alone, because what it does is
 *           decided by a parameter (an arbitrary python string, a wrapped tool
 *           name). Gated exactly like `mutate`.
 *
 * Unclassifiable is a real answer here, not a shrug: an `unknown` action still
 * requires an explicit target, so the honest label costs nothing at the gate
 * and stops a guess from being recorded as fact.
