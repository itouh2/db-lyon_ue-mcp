# Development

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- Unreal Engine 5.4–5.8 (for live testing)
- A UE project to test against

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/db-lyon/ue-mcp.git
cd ue-mcp
npm install
```

## Resolving an Issue with Claude Code

From inside your `ue-mcp` clone:

```bash
npx ue-mcp resolve 16
```

This:

1. Fetches issue #16 from `db-lyon/ue-mcp` via `gh`.
2. Creates a `resolve/16` branch from `origin/main` in your current checkout.
3. Pipes a generated prompt (issue body + repo conventions) into `claude --print --dangerously-skip-permissions`.
4. Claude reads code, implements the fix, runs `npx tsc --noEmit`, and commits.
5. The script then pushes the branch and opens a PR against `db-lyon/ue-mcp`.

Requires `gh` and `claude` CLIs, write access to the repo (or a fork to push to), and you must run it from inside a `ue-mcp` clone - it operates on the working tree, not a temp clone.

## Building

```bash
npx tsc                # TypeScript -> dist/ (what the server ships as)
npm run build          # UE C++ plugin build (requires editor closed)
```

`npx tsc` emits the TypeScript server into `dist/`. `npm run build` is the C++ plugin build that runs Unreal's build tool against the test project and requires the editor to be closed first.

The build script only ever builds the `ue_mcpEditor` target against the bundled `tests/ue_mcp/ue_mcp.uproject`, and it refuses to start if that resolves anywhere else. It also passes `-NoEngineChanges`, so Unreal itself aborts the build and prints the offending file list if the build would overwrite a file that already exists under the engine tree. That is what keeps a test build from invalidating the outputs of a shared source engine you use for other work.

Engine selection order is `UE_MCP_TEST_ENGINE_ROOT`, then `UE_BUILD_TOOL_PATH`, then the default install locations. A pinned root that has no build tool is an error rather than a silent fallback to an engine you did not ask for.

Two optional environment variables tune the guard:

```powershell
# Roots the build and run scripts must never touch, whatever else is set.
$env:UE_MCP_PROTECTED_ENGINE_ROOTS = 'D:\UE-Primary;D:\UE-Release'

# Pin the engine used for test builds and editor launches.
$env:UE_MCP_TEST_ENGINE_ROOT = 'D:\UE-Test'

npm run build
```

`UE_MCP_PROTECTED_ENGINE_ROOTS` uses the platform path-list delimiter (`;` on Windows, `:` on macOS and Linux). A selected engine equal to or nested under a protected root is rejected, including when it arrives through `UE_BUILD_TOOL_PATH` or `UE_EDITOR_PATH`.

A fresh engine may need to create its engine-side outputs once. For that bootstrap only, set `UE_MCP_ALLOW_TEST_ENGINE_CHANGES=true` to drop `-NoEngineChanges`. Protected roots stay forbidden even with this opt-in, and the build prints a warning naming the variable so an opt-in left in your environment is visible. Use `npm run up:build` to chain stop-build-start during plugin iteration.

## Running

```bash
# Build and run
npm run up:build

# Run (assumes already built)
npm run up

# Dev mode (tsx, no build step)
npm run dev

# Direct
node dist/index.js C:/path/to/MyGame.uproject

# Interactive setup (also available via npx ue-mcp init)
node dist/index.js init C:/path/to/MyGame.uproject
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Pure-TypeScript tests under `tests/unit/`. No editor required.

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

These also run in CI on every PR.

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests run against a **live editor** and verify tool functionality end-to-end.

```bash
# Specific suite
npm run test:level
npm run test:blueprint
npm run test:material
# ... 16 suites total - see scripts in package.json

# All suites (Vitest)
npm test

# Full smoke test runner - exercises every registered handler
npm run test:smoke
```

!!! warning "Smoke tests require the test project"
    The smoke runner targets `tests/ue_mcp/ue_mcp.uproject` only. Real mutations execute against the connected editor (creating blueprints, deleting assets, modifying the level). **Never run smoke tests against a real project.** After connecting, the runner asks the editor which project it has open and aborts before sending anything if the answer is not `tests/ue_mcp`. Non-loopback hosts are refused outright.

!!! note "Prerequisites"
    - Editor running with the test project
    - Bridge connected (`project(action="get_status")` returns `editorConnected: true`)

#### How the harness finds the bridge

The editor binds a per-project port, not a fixed one, and publishes the port it
actually bound to `tests/ue_mcp/Saved/UE_MCP_Bridge/port.json`. Both harnesses
(`scripts/smoke-test.js` and the Vitest suites) resolve the endpoint through
`scripts/bridge-target.mjs`, which probes in this order:

1. The port recorded in that lockfile.
2. The port derived from the project path, which is what the bridge binds when
   nothing is in its way.
3. The legacy fixed port `9877`, for older bridges.

Start the editor and run the tests; no environment variable is needed. When
nothing answers, the failure names the lockfile path it read, the state that
file was in (missing, malformed, or stale with a dead pid), and every port it
tried. `--port` on the runner and `UE_MCP_TEST_PORT` for the Vitest suites still
pin the port for unusual setups, and neither weakens the project check above.

### Live Tier

The live tier drives a real editor through the shipped server: the advertised
surface with an editor attached, per-path dispatch, addressing, gating, and the
records the bridge publishes.

```bash
npm run test:live
```

It attaches to an editor that is **already running** and never starts or stops
one. The preflight finds the bridge, asks the editor which project it has open,
prints the target, and aborts with the ports it tried when nothing answers, so
"no editor" is one message rather than a wall of failed assertions. Like the
smoke runner, it drives `tests/ue_mcp` and refuses every other project.

- **One editor is enough.** Cases that need more than one editor use a second
  session for a throwaway project whose editor is not running: a session is
  registered for every project regardless of editor state, and the session
  count is what arms targeting, gating and the union refusal.
- **The leak assertions need the parameter echo**, which can only be armed when
  the editor process starts. Launch the editor with `UE_MCP_PARAM_ECHO=1` in its
  environment to include them; without it they skip and the runner says so.
- `tests/live/matrix.ts` records, case by case, where each assertion lives, and
  `tests/live/coverage.test.ts` checks every reference still resolves.

| `widget` | Widget blueprint creation, tree manipulation, slot properties |
| `networking` | Replication config |
| `gas` | GAS component inspection |

## Adding a New Tool

### TypeScript Side

1. Create `src/tools/myfeature.ts`:

```typescript
import { categoryTool, bp, type ToolDef } from '../types.js';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const myfeatureTool: ToolDef = categoryTool(
  'myfeature',
  'Description of this tool category',
  {
    my_action: bp('my_cpp_handler_method'),
    local_action: {
      handler: async (ctx, params) => {
        // local implementation
        return { result: 'done' };
      },
    },
  },
  '- my_action: Does something. Params: foo, bar\n- local_action: Does something locally.',
  {
    foo: z.string().optional().describe('Description of foo'),
  },
);
```

2. Register it in `src/index.ts`.

### C++ Side

1. Create handler files in `plugin/ue_mcp_bridge/Source/UE_MCP_Bridge/Private/Handlers/`
2. Register handlers in `BridgeServer.cpp`
3. Each handler receives `TSharedPtr<FJsonObject>` params and returns `TSharedPtr<FJsonValue>`

## C++ Plugin Development

The plugin source lives in `plugin/ue_mcp_bridge/`. When you modify C++ handler code:

1. Edit the source in `plugin/ue_mcp_bridge/`
2. The deployer copies the plugin to the target project on server start
3. In the editor, use **Live Coding** (Ctrl+Alt+F11) or `editor(action="hot_reload")` to reload

For a full editor restart: `editor(action="restart_editor")`

## Dependencies

### Runtime
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - MCP protocol implementation
- `ws` - WebSocket client
- `zod` - Schema validation

### Dev
