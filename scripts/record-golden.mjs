/**
 * Re-record a golden baseline (#817, plan item 1.10).
 *
 *     npm run golden:record                 the editor-down half
 *     npm run golden:record -- --connected   the editor-connected half
 *
 * Deliberately the same code path each guard uses: it runs the guard test with
 * UE_MCP_RECORD_GOLDEN=1, which makes it write the baseline instead of
 * asserting against it. A separate recorder would be a second implementation
 * of the surface capture, and the baseline would then only prove the two
 * implementations agree with each other.
 *
 * The connected half goes through scripts/live-tier.mjs, so it gets the same
 * preflight as the rest of the live tier: the editor is found, proved to have
 * tests/ue_mcp open, and named before anything is recorded from it.
 *
 * Review the resulting diff before committing. It is the contract every client
 * sees at startup.
