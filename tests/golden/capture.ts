/**
 * Records the #817 plan item 1.10 golden corpus, both halves.
 *
 * The surface a client sees at startup has two legitimate shapes, because
 * Epic-toolset enrichment picks a live editor, then the project cache, then
 * the snapshot baked into the package (`src/index.ts`, `buildSessionLoad`).
 * One baseline therefore cannot tell a regression from a cold start, so the
 * corpus is recorded twice:
 *
 *   - `editor-down.json`, with nothing listening. Needs only Node, so it is
 *     guarded by `tests/unit/golden-editor-down.test.ts` in the unit tier.
 *   - `editor-connected.json`, with a real editor answering. Guarded by
 *     `tests/live/golden-connected.test.ts` in the live tier.
 *
 * One recorder produces both. A second implementation of the capture would
 * make the two baselines prove that the two recorders agree with each other
 * rather than that the server still hands a client the same thing.
 *
 * It drives the shipped entry point over stdio rather than reassembling the
 * surface in-process. A baseline built from a copy of the construction code
 * only ever proves the copy still agrees with itself; going through
 * `initialize` and `tools/list` proves what a client is actually handed.
 *
 * Everything that varies by machine is either pinned or normalized:
 *
 *   - the project lives in a fresh temp directory, and its path is rewritten
 *     to `<PROJECT_DIR>` wherever it appears;
 *   - the repository root is rewritten to `<REPO>`;
 *   - the bridge port is rewritten to `<PORT>` and any ISO timestamp to
 *     `<TIMESTAMP>`, so the connected half does not churn every time the
 *     editor rebinds or restarts;
 *   - the editor-down half pins `UE_MCP_PORT=1`, which guarantees its branch.
 *     Port 1 is privileged on every platform we run on, so nothing can be
 *     listening there and the connection is refused immediately instead of
 *     burning the connect budget;
 *   - every other `UE_MCP_*` variable inherited from the recording shell is
 *     dropped, and the three user-scoped files the server reads (global
 *     config, user state, auth) are redirected into the temp directory so a
 *     developer's own settings never reach the baseline;
 *   - the update check is off, so no network call can change what is recorded;
 *   - the actions enrichment injected from the editor's toolset registry are
 *     sorted, because the registry does not promise one enumeration order from
 *     one editor session to the next. See `canonicalizeActionOrder`. This
 *     normalizes the recording only: what the server advertises is untouched.
 *
 * The connected half deliberately keeps the throwaway project rather than
 * recording against the editor's own project directory. The only difference
 * between the two recordings is then that a live bridge answers: same project,
 * same config, same plugin set, and a temp project that has never been
 * enriched cannot serve a cached catalog. That is what makes the connected
 * baseline evidence about the live-editor path specifically, and it is
 * asserted rather than assumed, because the recorder reads back the
 * enrichment source the server logged.

// in a different sequence, and the connected baseline then reports a surface
// change on a healthy editor.
//
