/**
 * One editor, before and after (#817, plan 7.3, and the eighteen enumerated
 * single-editor changes).
 *
 * The promise the whole of #817 rests on is that a user with one editor sees
 * no change beyond eighteen fixes. Half of that is the golden corpus, which
 * compares the advertised surface byte for byte. This is the other half: the
 * behaviour those eighteen rows describe, asserted against a real editor.
 *
 * Each test says what the behaviour was before the change and what it is
 * after, because a row like "start_editor refuses on its own project" only
 * means something next to the bug it replaced (refusing because SOME editor
 * was running, anywhere on the machine).
 *
 * Three rows cannot be asserted here and say so where they sit: a restart
 * inside TIME_WAIT, a pinned self-launched editor, and the stop-failure branch
 * of restart all need an editor to be started or stopped, and this tier
 * attaches to one somebody else owns. They belong to the C++ automation tier
 * (plan item 0.9), which can drive a process of its own.
