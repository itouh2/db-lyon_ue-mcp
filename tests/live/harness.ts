/**
 * Shared plumbing for the live tier (#817, plan items 1.10 and 7.3).
 *
 * The live tier is the only tier that talks to a real Unreal editor. Two rules
 * follow from that and both are enforced here rather than left to each test:
 *
 *  1. **It only ever drives `tests/ue_mcp`.** The editor is asked which project
 *     it has open before anything else is sent, and any other answer aborts the
 *     run. This is the same guard `scripts/bridge-target.mjs` applies to the
 *     smoke harness, for the same reason: these runs execute real calls against
 *     a real editor.
 *  2. **No editor is started or stopped.** The tier attaches to an editor that
 *     is already up and leaves it exactly as it found it. Every case that would
 *     need a launch or a shutdown is asserted read-only, or against a fabricated
 *     bridge, and says so where it is written.
 *
 * When no editor is running, discovery fails with the ports it tried and the
 * lockfile it read, rather than hanging or quietly passing.
