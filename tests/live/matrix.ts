/**
 * The 7.3 matrix, written down (#817).
 *
 * Plan item 7.3 enumerates the cases the multi-editor work has to be tested
 * against. A list in a plan file cannot say whether it is satisfied, so it is
 * transcribed here with, for each case, where the assertion actually lives:
 *
 *   - `live`       an assertion in this tier, against a real editor;
 *   - `engine-free` an assertion in the tier that needs no engine. Referenced
 *                  rather than duplicated: running the same check twice does
 *                  not make it truer, and a live copy of an engine-free test
 *                  is a test that only runs when somebody has an editor up;
 *   - `cpp`        owned by the plugin's own automation tier (plan item 0.9),
 *                  because it is about a socket option, a bind result or a
 *                  process lifetime that no client-side test can observe;
 *   - `pending`    the behaviour has not shipped yet. Named with the plan item
 *                  that ships it, so the row is a to-do rather than a silence.
 *
 * `coverage.test.ts` checks every reference against the file it names, so a
 * renamed or deleted test breaks this list instead of quietly emptying it.
