/**
 * The editor-connected golden baseline (#817, plan item 1.10).
 *
 * Plan item 1.10 asks for the single-editor surface recorded twice, with the
 * editor connected and with it down, because Epic-toolset enrichment picks a
 * live editor, then the project cache, then the snapshot baked into the
 * package. The surface legitimately differs between those states, so one
 * baseline cannot tell a regression from a cold start.
 *
 * This is the connected half, and it is the reason the tier exists: the
 * recording only means anything if the server it recorded really did enrich
 * from a live editor. That is asserted, not assumed. The recorder pins a
 * throwaway project that has never been enriched, so there is no cache for the
 * catalog to come from, and then reads back the enrichment source the server
 * narrated at startup. A recording that fell through to the baked snapshot
 * fails here rather than being committed as evidence of something it is not.
 *
 * Both halves run in this tier (plan 7.3), so a change that moves the surface
 * only when an editor is attached, or only when it is not, has one place that
 * catches either.
 *
 * To re-record on purpose:  npm run golden:record -- --connected
