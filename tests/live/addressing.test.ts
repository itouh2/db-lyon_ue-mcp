/**
 * Addressing, gating and the union surface against a real editor (#817, 7.3).
 *
 * The multi-editor cases need more than one session, and this machine has one
 * editor. That is not a limitation to work around: a session is registered for
 * every argv project regardless of editor state (plan item 4.4), and the
 * session COUNT is what arms targeting, gating, attribution and the union
 * refusal. So the server here drives two sessions, the live editor and a
 * throwaway project whose editor is not running, and every assertion about
 * "beyond one editor" is made with a real editor on one side of it.
 *
 * What that buys over the engine-free tier: these run through the shipped
 * entry point rather than through the routing functions directly, so a refusal
 * that is never wired in, a union that advertises what dispatch cannot serve,
 * or an attribution block that never reaches the client all fail here.
 *
 * Nothing here starts or stops an editor, and every call that reaches the live
 * editor is either a read or a change to an asset path that does not exist.
