/**
 * What a flow run hands back, engine-free (#817).
 *
 * Two properties, and they only mean something together:
 *
 *  1. A step sees the whole tool context. `makeRunner` spreads the context it
 *     was given rather than rebuilding it field by field, which used to drop
 *     `elicit`, `getFlows`, `getPlugins` and the editor session, so an action
 *     called inside a flow saw a different server than the same action called
 *     directly.
 *  2. The run response carries what each step answered. Without that, the
 *     first property is unobservable from outside, and a flow that reads
 *     anything returns a summary line and no data at all.
 *
 * The live tier asserts the same pair against a real editor
 * (tests/live/single-editor.test.ts, "hands a flow the whole context").
