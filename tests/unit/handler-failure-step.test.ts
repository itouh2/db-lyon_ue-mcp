/**
 * A handler that reports its own failure must fail the flow step it ran as,
 * and must not break the MCP category-tool call that reads the body itself.
 *
 * `Bridge.call` rejects on a transport fault and on a JSON-RPC `error`, and
 * resolves everything else - so `{ success: false, error: "..." }` came back
 * by the same route a successful answer did. Both task classes hardcoded
 * `success: true` onto the `TaskResult` they built from it, which made every
 * handler-reported failure a PASSING step: the runner walked on through the
 * plan, `on_failure` never fired, the git snapshot was never restored, and
 * `rollback_on_failure` only ever reacted to a transport fault. A destructive
 * action that emptied an asset and said so ran a flow to completion reporting
 * success.
 *
 * The two routes want opposite things from that verdict, so they are told
 * apart rather than forced onto one behaviour (see `flow/handler-outcome.ts`):
 *
 *   - a flow step FAILS, because the runner is the thing that has to stop;
 *   - a category-tool call does NOT, because `index.ts` renders a failed
 *     `TaskResult` as `Error [TASK_FAILED]: <message>` and never serializes
 *     `result.data`, so failing there would delete the response body - error
 *     detail, per-item verdicts, rollback descriptor - from every handler that
 *     reports its own failure.
 *
 * The rollback descriptor is attached on both routes and on both verdicts. A
 * previous change in this area silently dropped every handler-emitted rollback
 * from ~90 actions; these tests exist so that cannot happen again quietly.

/**
 * A handler that PARTLY applied its mutation before giving up attaches the

 * `success: false`. Four shipped handlers do exactly this on purpose:
 * RenameWorldWithExternals, FixAssetHygiene, GenerateLightmapUvs and
 * FractureMesh; the first states the contract in its own comment.
 *
 * From flowkit 0.17.1 the runner harvests an inverse from every step carrying
 * one, and invokes the array in reverse, so the failing step's record - pushed
 * last - is the FIRST one replayed and the steps before it unwind behind it.
 * `rollback_on_failure` is the whole switch. Armed, the undo already ran;
 * unarmed, nothing replayed it and the record is handed to the caller rather
 * than destroyed. These tests pin both halves, because reporting an undo as
 * pending when it already ran is the same class of error as losing it.
 *
 * Up to 0.17.0 the harvest was gated on `taskResult.success`, so this record
 * was discarded on every run. `plans/flowkit-failed-step-rollback.md` is the
 * proposal that became 0.17.1.

/**
 * `ignore_failure`, which is where an expected failure belongs.
 *
 * The alternative is a handler that answers `success: true` to a call that did
 * nothing, so that a flow which stops, builds and starts the editor survives an
 * editor that was already stopped. That trades one honest report for one
 * shorter plan, and every OTHER caller of that handler is then told the editor
 * was closed when it was not. flowkit already carries the right hook: the step
 * that expects the failure declares it, the runner records the failure and
 * walks on, and nothing about the handler's answer changes.
 *
 * Read off `node_modules/@db-lyon/flowkit/dist/flow/runner.js`: the flag is
 * planned onto the step (`planStepFromDef`), and consulted on the failed-result
 * path, the thrown path, and the `when:`-threw path. Each sets
 * `ignoredFailure` on the step result and continues without setting
 * `flowError`.
