 * The wire protocol version is declared twice: once in the plugin header the
 * editor compiles, once in the client that talks to it. Only one of the two is
 * ever edited when someone changes the wire, and the symptom of the other
 * lagging is a client that reports a mismatch against itself, or worse, one
 * that reports agreement across a change it cannot actually read.
 *
 * The two files cannot import from each other, so this test is the joint.
