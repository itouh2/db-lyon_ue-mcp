 * #973: a scripted call runs inside FEditorScriptExecutionGuard, which sets
 * GAllowActorScriptExecutionInEditor, and AActor::GetFunctionCallspace answers
 * Local unconditionally on that global. deferToNextTick is the opt-in that
 * moves the send outside the guard's scope. If the flag is dropped anywhere
 * between the schema and the bridge, the call silently keeps the wrong
 * routing, so the passthrough is asserted rather than assumed.
