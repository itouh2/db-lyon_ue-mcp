/**
 * The editor-down golden baseline (#817, plan item 1.10).
 *
 * Plan item 1.10 asks for the single-editor surface recorded twice, once with
 * an editor connected and once with it down, because Epic-toolset enrichment
 * legitimately changes the surface between those two states and one baseline
 * cannot tell a regression apart from a cold start. The editor-down half needs
 * nothing but Node, so it is recorded here and it gates merges. The connected
 * half needs a running editor and lives in the live tier
 * (`tests/live/golden-connected.test.ts`, `npm run test:live`), which also
 * re-verifies this one.
 *
 * What it guards: the `initialize` instructions and every tool in
 * `tools/list` with its full input schema. That is the entire contract a
 * client sees before it makes a single call, and it is the thing the
 * multi-editor work is required to leave byte-identical at one editor (plan
 * items 2.1, 3.1, 4.2, 5.1).
 *
 * To re-record on purpose:  npm run golden:record
